                                    at
                                    addressing safety concerns for bikers in Madison, where many people prefer biking as
                                    their mode

                                <p>Blink-It is a bike safety vest that incorporates wearable technology, featuring a remote
                                    control
                                    that uses infrared technology to communicate with a microcontroller in the vest to
                                    activate
                                    blinkers. The accelerometer data is used to trigger the brake lights when I am
