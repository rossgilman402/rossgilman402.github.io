                <h1>Wearable Technology</h1>
                <ul>
                    <li>I presented Blink-It as my final project in the Wearable Technology course, which aimed at
                        addressing safety concerns for bikers in Madison, where many people prefer biking as their mode
                        of transportation.</li>
                    <li>Blink-It is a bike safety vest that incorporates wearable technology, featuring a remote control
                        that uses infrared technology to communicate with a microcontroller in the vest to activate
                        blinkers. The accelerometer data is used to trigger the brake lights when I am decelerating,
                        ensuring safety for myself and those around me.</li>
                    <li>I worked collaboratively with my classmates to develop Blink-It, learning valuable skills along
                        the way, such as creating circuits using sewable threading and programming Arduino circuits. Our
                        teamwork and collaboration were critical to the project's success, providing an innovative and
                        practical solution to the safety concerns of bikers in Madison.</li>

                <ul>
                    <li>Throughout the course, I developed both basic and advanced Java programming skills, including
                        object-oriented programming, inheritance, polymorphism, and exception handling.</li>
                    <li>I gained proficiency in various data structures, such as linked lists, arrays, 2D arrays, hash
                        tables, and binary search trees. These data structures are fundamental to software development
                        and are essential for efficient and effective data management.</li>
                    <li>I also studied different algorithms, such as Dijkstra's shortest path and minimum spanning tree.
                        These algorithms are crucial in solving complex problems and are essential for developing
                        efficient and optimal software solutions. By studying and applying these algorithms, I learned
                        how to optimize code and streamline software development processes.</li>

                <ul>
                    <li>As part of my coursework, I studied and applied various complex algorithms, including greedy,
                        recursive, dynamic programming, and divide and conquer. These algorithms are essential to
                        developing efficient software solutions to complex problems.</li>
                    <li>I learned how to analyze and optimize the time and space complexity of algorithms by studying
                        their computational complexity and big-O notation. By mastering these concepts, I was able to
                        develop more efficient algorithms and improve the performance of existing algorithms.</li>
                    <li>Throughout the course, I completed proofs to demonstrate the correctness and efficiency of the
                        algorithms I developed. This helped me to refine my problem-solving skills and develop a deeper
                        understanding of the principles of algorithm design.</li>
                    <li>By mastering these advanced Java skills, data structures, and algorithms, I am well-equipped to
                        tackle complex software development challenges and contribute to the development of innovative
                        software solutions.</li>
