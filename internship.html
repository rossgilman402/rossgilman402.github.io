                    <h2>My internship!</h2>
                    <p>During my internship at Relay Network, I played a pivotal role in introducing the Java language
                        to their distributed system.
                        To achieve this, I executed Request for Comments (RFC) forms, which allowed for a smooth
                        transition to the new language.
                        Throughout the internship, I gained hands-on experience in agile software development by
                        performing scrum style bi-weekly sprints, grooming tickets, and attending sprint retrospective
                        reviews.
                        I also had the opportunity to work on an important project, where I implemented an Apache Kafka
                        KStream.
                        This involved developing a producer and consumer that could serialize and deserialize JSON on
                        click and notification events from the Relay feed, specifically for customer billing purposes.
                        Through this project, I contributed to the scalability of the system and gained valuable
                        experience in working with a highly distributed system.
                        Additionally, I got to meet new people and expand my professional network, while also showcasing
                        my strong teamwork skills.
                        Overall, my internship at Relay Network provided me with valuable insights into software
                        engineering and helped me develop essential skills for my future career in the field.</p>
